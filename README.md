# Python for Data Science Learning Path 📊

This repository contains my practice notebooks from my Python for Data Science course.
I’m using it to document my learning progress and keep all my exercises in one place.

## Topics Covered
- Python basics (variables, loops, functions)
- NumPy and pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib & seaborn
- Basic data analysis workflows

I’ll continue updating this repo as I learn more and start working on real projects.
